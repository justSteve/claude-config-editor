The following is a transcript that documents the locations of various CC settings and configs. Let's replicate the original scans conducted by this tool against these properties.


Yes, I can provide definitive answers about Claude Code's paths for tooling and configs based on our documentation.
Settings files hierarchy:
User settings: ~/.claude/settings.json
Project settings: .claude/settings.json (shared) and .claude/settings.local.json (personal)
Enterprise managed settings:
• macOS: /Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json
• Linux/WSL: /etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json
• Windows: C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json
Memory files (CLAUDE.md):
User memory: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
Project memory: ./CLAUDE.md
Enterprise memory: Same paths as managed settings but with CLAUDE.md
Subagents:
User subagents: ~/.claude/agents/
Project subagents: .claude/agents/
These paths follow a hierarchical precedence where enterprise settings override user/project settings.

but to do so with windows paths, please

Here are the definitive Windows paths for Claude Code tooling and configs:
Settings files:
User settings: %USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json
Project settings: .claude\settings.json (shared) and .claude\settings.local.json (personal)
Enterprise managed settings: C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json
Memory files (CLAUDE.md):
User memory: %USERPROFILE%\.claude\CLAUDE.md
Project memory: .\CLAUDE.md
Enterprise memory: C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\CLAUDE.md
Subagents:
User subagents: %USERPROFILE%\.claude\agents\
Project subagents: .claude\agents\
Claude Desktop config:
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
These follow the same hierarchical precedence where enterprise settings override user/project settings.

and all tooling like mcps and slash commands... they would all be in one of the above?
Steve • 1m
Yes, all tooling including MCPs and slash commands are stored in the Windows paths I mentioned:
Slash commands:
Project commands: .claude\commands\
Personal commands: %USERPROFILE%\.claude\commands\
MCP servers:
Local scope: Stored in user settings at %USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json
Project scope: Stored in .mcp.json at project root
Claude Desktop MCP config:
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
All custom tooling, extensions, and configurations use these standardized Windows paths within the .claude directory structure or the Claude Desktop app data folder.

great -- i'd also like locations for logs including errors
Steve • Just now
Here are the Windows log locations for Claude Code and Claude Desktop:
Claude Desktop MCP logs:
%APPDATA%\Claude\Logs\mcp*.log
Error reporting:
Claude Code uses Sentry for operational error logging (encrypted in transit and at rest)
To disable error reporting, set the DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING environment variable
Telemetry logs:
Claude Code connects to Statsig for operational metrics like latency and reliability
To disable telemetry, set the DISABLE_TELEMETRY environment variable
The MCP logs contain information about server connections, errors, and message exchanges, which should help troubleshoot your console freezing issue.
