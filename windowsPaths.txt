Here are the definitive Windows paths for Claude Code tooling and configs:
Settings files:
User settings: %USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json
Project settings: .claude\settings.json (shared) and .claude\settings.local.json (personal)
Enterprise managed settings: \managed-settings.json
Memory files (CLAUDE.md):
User memory: %USERPROFILE%\.claude\CLAUDE.md
Project memory: .\CLAUDE.md
Enterprise memory: C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\CLAUDE.md
Subagents:
User subagents: %USERPROFILE%\.claude\agents\
Project subagents: .claude\agents\
Claude Desktop config:
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
These follow the same hierarchical precedence where enterprise settings override user/project settings.

and all tooling like mcps and slash commands... they would all be in one of the above?

Yes, all tooling including MCPs and slash commands are stored in the Windows paths I mentioned:
Slash commands:
Project commands: .claude\commands\
Personal commands: %USERPROFILE%\.claude\commands\
MCP servers:
Local scope: Stored in user settings at %USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json
Project scope: Stored in .mcp.json at project root
Claude Desktop MCP config:
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
All custom tooling, extensions, and configurations use these standardized Windows paths within the .claude directory structure or the Claude Desktop app data folder.

great -- i'd also like locations for logs including errors
Steve • Just now
Here are the Windows log locations for Claude Code and Claude Desktop:
Claude Desktop MCP logs:
%APPDATA%\Claude\Logs\mcp*.log
Error reporting:
Claude Code uses Sentry for operational error logging (encrypted in transit and at rest)
To disable error reporting, set the DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING environment variable
Telemetry logs:
Claude Code connects to Statsig for operational metrics like latency and reliability
To disable telemetry, set the DISABLE_TELEMETRY environment variable
The MCP logs contain information about server connections, errors, and message exchanges, which should help troubleshoot your console freezing issue.
